=====================================

           Login a Client/Server
		      and MySQL C API
			  application.
			  
		Borys H.N.
		3.13.12 
		
=====================================
	
Pre-Requisites!
1) MySQL Server installed and running
     !use supplied SQL to build Login.users DB and table
	 !IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE DB AND TABLE SETUP CORRECTLY THE PROGRAM WILL FAIL! OBVS 
	 !IF YOU DO NOT HAVE MYSQL SERVER UP AND RUNNING THE PROGRAM WILL EXIT REALLY QUICKLY! OBVS  
2) Visual C++ and or equivelant libraries to handle winsock
   exchanges. I am using Windows Visual Studio C++ Express 2010 on a 32bit Windows Vista Machine. 
   Centrino2... oh yea. Beefin up. w/e. It works. 
   
Instructions...
*once you've already done pre-requisites
1) Create a solution with 2 projects, Client and Server
2) Set Client dependency to Server, and have them both startup at the same time.
3) Add code and compile!
	*
	**REMBER TO INCLUDE YOUR LOGIN INFO FOR THE MYSQL DB IN UsersManager.cpp
	**REMEBER TO EDIT SERVER NAME IN Server.cpp IF YOU NEED THAT CHANGED
	*
	I compiled for 32bit Windows Vista. Your structures may change slightly
	a different operating system.
4) Run Server!
	1. give it port number (same one to be used by Client!)
	2. start server (s), make it wait for a connection(w)
5) Run Client!
	1. give it the server name (i.e. 127.0.0.1, localhost, 192.168.0.x)
	2. give it the port which the server listens on...
	3. If everything went succesfuly you should be able to press (c) and connect
		to the host. The host will assign the connection its own port number.
	4. press (m) to bring up the send message menu, and get that dialogue going! 
	
For the future...
(!)Server throws AV excpetion...
(!)Encrypted logins for users in database (unencrypt by server) 
(!)Root auth only for server
(!)encryt user name and password for MySQL DB (hard coded in UsersManager.cpp)
